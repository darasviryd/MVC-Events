- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- **EJS:** A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


git clone 
(https://github.com/darasviryd/MVC-Events.git)

2. Install Dependencies

Install all required npm packages:


npm install express ejs

Express is the web server framework.
EJS is the template engine used for rendering HTML.

3. Start the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:


node app.js
This command starts the server. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the server is running, typically on port 3000.

4. Access the Application

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Additional Information
Make sure that your project's root directory has a file named app.js (or adjust the command accordingly if your main file has a different name). This file should correctly set up Express and EJS, configure routes, and start the server.

If you encounter any issues during installation or while running the application, verify that all paths in your code are correctly set, and check the console for any error messages that might indicate what went wrong.

This setup will guide users through the process of getting your project running on their local machines, assuming they have Node.js and npm already installed.
